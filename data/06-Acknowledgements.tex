\indent\indent I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my faculty advisor, Dr. Philip Ritchey, for his exceptional guidance and support throughout the duration of this project. Dr. Ritchey's insightful advice and helpful pointers have been invaluable to me during my entire college career at Texas A\&M University, and especially so in my interactions with him on this project. His expertise and practical approach have greatly enhanced my learning experience.

\indent\indent Thanks also go to my friends Teddy Heinen, Nathan Nguyen, Lucy Zhang, Chris Kelley, Michael McCarthy, Winnie Phung, and Matt Krehel that I have had the amazing pleasure to meet, and the department faculty and staff for making my time at Texas A\&M University a great experience. 

\indent\indent I would like to thank, last but definitely not least, to my partner Emmie Teng for her patience, love, and all the help through everything.
