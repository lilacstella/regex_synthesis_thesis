% Enter the name(s) and department(s) of your advisor(s). Don't forget to include "Dr." if they have a PhD. If they don't have a PhD, use their post-nominal letters. 
% The template includes two advisor slots. If you only have one, delete the secondary advisor slot. However, if you have two or more advisors, be sure to include them on the Title page exactly as you list them here. If both advisors are in the same department, you can place their names on the same line. However, if they belong to different departments, give them their own sections. If you have more than two advisors, copy and paste one of the sections below text below and modify accordingly.

\indent\indent This paper explores the automatic generation of computer programs from high-level specifications. As the project currently stands, we are replicating the AlphaRegex study, a foundational approach that synthesizes regular expressions from positive and negative examples using a heuristic-guided greedy search. This replication aims to validate existing findings, identify potential limitations, and establish a baseline for further research.

\indent\indent By examining the AlphaRegex implementation of cost-based heuristics, state pruning, and optimization techniques, this study seeks to gain deeper insights into program synthesis and the expression of user intents. 


\indent\indent The broader goal of this project is to contribute to advancing program synthesis methodologies, bridging the gap between user intent and automated code generation. The findings from this study will serve as a stepping stone for developing robust and efficient tools capable of automating complex programming tasks.
