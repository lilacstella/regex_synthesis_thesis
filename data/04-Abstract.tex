% Enter the name(s) and department(s) of your advisor(s). Don't forget to include "Dr." if they have a PhD. If they don't have a PhD, use their post-nominal letters. 
% The template includes two advisor slots. If you only have one, delete the secondary advisor slot. However, if you have two or more advisors, be sure to include them on the Title page exactly as you list them here. If both advisors are in the same department, you can place their names on the same line. However, if they belong to different departments, give them their own sections. If you have more than two advisors, copy and paste one of the sections below text below and modify accordingly.

\indent\indent This thesis explores the problem of test-driven program synthesis in the domain of regular expressions (regex), a class of formal languages that is both foundational in computer science and notoriously difficult to author manually. Despite their widespread use in tasks like data validation and pattern matching, regular expressions remain a pain point for many developers due to their terse syntax and limited readability. We investigate the capacity of three distinct synthesis paradigms—heuristic search (AlphaRegex), procedural inference (L* algorithm), and neural generation (LLMs such as ChatGPT)—to generate correct, minimal, and human-readable regex from a set of positive and negative examples.

\indent\indent Our study introduces a shared benchmark suite of 25 regex generation problems of varying complexity and evaluates each method across dimensions of correctness, efficiency, and complexity. AlphaRegex uses weighted explicit search and formal approximations to prune the search space. The L* algorithm leverages query-based learning minimal finite state machines. LLMs rely on prompt engineering to translate natural language and example-based input into regex output.

\indent\indent We find that while no single method dominates across all metrics, each has clear strengths: AlphaRegex is transparent and tunable, L* provides principled correctness under guided feedback, and LLMs deliver impressive speed and usability. Preliminary experiments in hybrid systems—where LLMs seed traditional synthesizers—suggest promising directions for future work. Ultimately, this thesis highlights both the challenges and potential in aligning human intent with machine-generated logic, using regex as a microcosm for broader program synthesis goals.
